Cosmos-Transfer1 is a key branch of Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) specialized for multimodal controllable conditional world generation or world2world transfer. The three main branches of Cosmos WFMs are [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1). We visualize the architecture of Cosmos-Transfer1 in the following figure.

Cosmos-Transfer1 includes the following:
- **ControlNet-based single modality conditional world generation** where a user can generate visual simulation based on one of the following modalities: segmentation video, depth video, edge video, blur video, LiDAR video, or HDMap video. Cosmos-Transfer1 generates a video based on the signal modality conditional input, a user text prompt, and, optionally, an input RGB video frame prompt (which could be from the last video generation result when operating in the autoregressive setting). We will use Cosmos-Transfer1-7B [Modality] to refer to the model operating in this setting. For example, Cosmos-Transfer1-7B [Depth] refers to a depth ControlNet model.
- **MultiControlNet-based multimodal conditional world generation** where a user can generate visual simulation based on any combination of segmentation video, depth video, edge video, and blur video (LiDAR video and HDMap in the AV sample) with a spatiotemporal control map to control the stregnth of each modality across space and time. Cosmos-Transfer1 generates a video based on the multimodal conditional inputs, a user text prompt, and, optionally, an input RGB video frame prompt (This could be from the last video generation result when operating in the autoregressive setting.). This is the preferred mode of Cosmos-Transfer. We will refer it as Cosmos-Transfer1-7B.
- **4KUpscaler** for upscaling a 720p-resolution video to a 4K-resolution video.
- **Post-training scripts** for helping Physical AI builders post-train pre-trained Cosmos-Transfer1 for their applications.
- **Pre-training scripts** for helping Physical AI builders train their own Cosmos-Transfer1 models from scratch.
